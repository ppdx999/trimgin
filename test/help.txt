Usage: trimgin [FILE]

Remove leading and trailing whitespace from text.
If FILE is not provided, read from stdin.

Hi there!
We have two blank lines above and below this text.
And this space will be removed by 'trimgin'.


```

```terminal
$ trimgin text.txt
Hi there!
We have two blank lines above and below this text.
And this space will be removed by 'trimgin'.
```
